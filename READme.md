# Overview
In this project, you'll create a web application for rating ramen dishes entirely from scratch. You'll practice handling user events, manipulating the DOM, structuring JavaScript code effectively, and using Git basics. No server communication or external servers are required; instead, you'll use static data provided within your project.

# Objectives
Use JavaScript to update the DOM based on user interactions dynamically

Practice handling user input and events

Organize your code logically into functions

Learn how to create and manage a project repository using Git

# Project Setup
Initialize your Project:

Create a new directory named ramen-rating-app.

Navigate into your project folder.

Start the app:

Create a index.html file with a basic HTML boilerplate.

Link your JavaScript file (index.js) to your HTML file using the <script> tag.

Open your index.html file directly in your browser.

# Git Workflow
Initialize a Git repository:

git init
Commit your changes regularly:

git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
Create a public GitHub repository and push your commits:

git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_LINK
git push -u origin main
